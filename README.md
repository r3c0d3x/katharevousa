# Katharevousa
Katharevousa is an attempt at coming up with a standard for a chan communication protocol. This includes API endpoints, schemas, etc.

## Plan

We will take inspiration from the chan APIs exposed by various engines, and from other similar efforts like [chan.arc](https://github.com/bibanon/chan.arc). The goal is to make a versatile communication platform so that we can easily handle data coming from any chan, regardless of whatever specific features it might have over another (one file per post vs multiple).

It is being developed for use with the [Ayase](https://github.com/r3c0d3x/ayase) system.
